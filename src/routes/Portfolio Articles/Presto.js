			<p className={generalStyles.p}>
				Presto is a React single-page web app that I'm currently developing. It
				is designed to be a media app for musicians to meet other local
				musicians and to get hired by people in the community. In today's day
				and age, meeting and hiring local musicians should be easy. Until now,
				though, it's been anything but. Presto is designed to reduce the
				barriers to collaboration by enabling guests and musicians to make
				public posts based on location. Need a singer? Make a post. Looking for
				a fill-in trumpet player for a gig this weekend? Write a post. Write a
				little on your own profile so that others can see what musical services
				you offer. Then, when you've found a musician that you'd like to work
				with, message them privately to connect.

			<h3 className={generalStyles.h3}>Purpose</h3>
			<p className={generalStyles.p}>
				Enabling local musicians to collaborate and be hired more easily. This
				app is intended for performers, composers, arrangers, conductors,
				soloists, ensembles, bands, and any people from their local community
				interested in hiring them.

			<h3 className={generalStyles.h3}>Tech</h3>
			<p className={generalStyles.p}>
				Presto was bootstrapped with Create React App, and is built to be a
				fast, secure, web app. Uses React Hooks and the Context API for
				authentication state management. For the backend, Presto uses the
				Firebase authentication, file storage, and database systems. Presto also
				makes use of the Geoapify API to validate users' location: they can
				either autofill their location using the built-in JavaScript Geolocation
				API, or they can manually input their location and select from the
				options provided by the Geoapify autocomplete API. For styling, Presto
				uses CSS modules and is inspired by Google's Material UIâ€”clean,
				accessible, and modern.
