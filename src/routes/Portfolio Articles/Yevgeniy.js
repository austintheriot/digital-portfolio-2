			<h3 className={generalStyles.h3}>About</h3>
			<p className={generalStyles.p}>
				Yevgeniy Sharlat is a classical composer currently based in Austin,
				Texas, and a recent recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship. I designed and
				coded this digital portfolio website for him so that others can quickly
				and easily find his music online and learn more about his work.

			</a>
			<h3 className={generalStyles.h3}>Purpose</h3>
			<p className={generalStyles.p}>
				This digital portfolio features Yevgeniy Sharlat's music prominently on
				the front page to allow visitors to quickly and easily listen to his
				music. If visitors wish, they can then proceed to the dedicated Music
				page of his website to browse a more robust selection of Mr. Sharlat's
				work. The website also allows visitors to browse his biography, read
				reviews of his work, and see news pertaining to his music.

			<h3 className={generalStyles.h3}>Tech</h3>
			<p className={generalStyles.p}>
				I built this page using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScriptâ€”although I believe
				that templates and libraries like Bootstrap a fast and useful way to
				build websites, I tend to my websites from scratch. This ensures that
				the needs of the client, and not whatever library I'm using at the
				moment determine the choices I make in the build process. Finally, as in
				all of the websites that I build for my clients, the contact page uses
				my own{' '}
				<Link className={generalStyles.trueLink} to='/email-api'>
					custom Email API
				</Link>{' '}
				to send the owner of the page an email upon form submission. This
				eliminates the need for a hosting service that allows server-side code
				and also cuts cost for my clients, who might otherwise be forced to pay
				for a third party email service.
